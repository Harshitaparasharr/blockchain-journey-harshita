# Day 2 – First Smart Contract (HelloHarshita)

Today I built my first smart contract using Solidity and Remix IDE.

✅ I wrote functions to get and set a `name`  
✅ I deployed it and changed the value  
✅ It was fun and exciting to see it working live!

I learned about:
- String variables
- Public functions
- `view` and `memory` keywords
- How to deploy and interact with smart contracts
