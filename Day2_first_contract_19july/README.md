# Day 2 - Learning Solidity and Writing First Contract

Today I learned the basics of Solidity language which is used to write smart contracts. I learned how to declare variables like string, uint, bool, and address. I also understood how to set visibility like public.

I wrote my first smart contract where I added my name, age, a boolean value, and wallet address. Then I compiled and deployed it using Remix IDE. After deploying, I tested it by calling functions and checking if the values were correct.

I also faced some errors in the beginning but I fixed them by reading carefully and following the structure of Solidity code properly.

This day helped me understand how smart contracts work in Ethereum. I will keep practicing and learning more.
