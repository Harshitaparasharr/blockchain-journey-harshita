# Day 1 - Blockchain Basics and My Motivation

Today I started my blockchain journey. I learned how blockchain is a decentralized system that stores data in blocks. Each block has its own hash, the previous block’s hash, and a timestamp. If anyone tries to change something in a block, its hash changes, and it breaks the whole chain. That’s why it is called tamper-proof.

I understood that blockchain uses Proof of Work to validate and add new blocks. Some common use cases of blockchain are Ethereum, NFTs, Bitcoin, etc.

I also wrote about why I want to become a blockchain developer. I want to do something big in less time and prove myself. I want to make a career, become independent, and get a job abroad. People laughed at me and judged me. Now I want to show them what I can do. I want to achieve everything I ever dreamed of.

This was the first step in my 60-day challenge.
