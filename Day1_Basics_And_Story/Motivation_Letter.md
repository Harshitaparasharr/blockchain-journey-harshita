# Why I Want to Become a Blockchain Developer

I want to become a blockchain developer because I want to do something big in my life. I’ve wasted enough time and now I want to change everything. People around me doubt me, some laugh at me, and even someone I loved left me because I wasn't stable.

Now I just want to prove to myself and to everyone else that I am capable. I’ve decided to give my 100% for the next 60 days, and I will get a job, first in India and then abroad. I want to make my family proud and live the life I dream about.

This journey is not just for career, it’s for my self-respect and my confidence. I’m not giving up now.
