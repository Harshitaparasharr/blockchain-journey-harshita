# Blockchain Basics – My Notes

Today I learned that blockchain is a decentralized system that stores data in the form of blocks. Every block has -

- Some transaction/data inside
- Its own hash
- The previous block’s hash

The first block is called the Genesis block. If any block is changed, its hash changes, which breaks the chain.

This makes it tamper-proof. Blockchain also uses Proof of Work to make it harder to fake a block. And a peer-to-peer network checks if the block is valid (needs 50%+ approval). That's how blockchain keeps things secure.
