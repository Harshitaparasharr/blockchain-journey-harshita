# Summary of the Article: “Learn Blockchain by Building One”

In this article, I understood how blockchain actually works inside. Here are my key points:

- A blockchain is just a list of blocks, where each block stores data.
- Each block has a hash, and also the previous block’s hash.
- The Genesis block is the first one and has no previous hash.
- If anyone tries to change the data in one block, it breaks the chain.
- To prevent this, the chain uses Proof of Work and hash functions.
- That makes blockchain tamper-proof.
- The chain is verified by peer-to-peer nodes.
- If more than 50% agree, a new block is accepted.
- It’s a simple but powerful idea.
- Blockchain is useful for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and NFTs.

It was fun to read and helped me understand why blockchain is secure.
